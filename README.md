# Linux Firmware Debug Kit (lfdk)

Fork to extend & fix for Ubuntu 16.04 (Kernel 4.13.0-37-generic), how to use:

1. sudo apt-get -y install libncurses5-dev
2. make
3. sudo insmod bin/lfdd_drv.ko
4. sudo bin/lfdk

```
lfdk version 2.0.2-1, Linux Firmware Debug Kit
Copyright (C) 2006 - 2010, Merck Hung <merckhung@gmail.com>
Usage: lfdk \[-h\] \[-d /dev/lfdd\] \[-n ./pci.ids\] \[-b 255\]
        -n      Filename of PCI Name Database, default is /usr/share/misc/pci.ids
        -d      Device name of Linux Firmware Debug Driver, default is /dev/lfdd
        -D      Debug level. All message logged to lfdd.log
        -b      Maximum PCI Bus number to scan, default is 255
        -B      PCIE MMIO base. It's 32bit hex digit preceding '0x' char.
        -h      print this message.
```

# Function

## PCI/PCIE list
The screenshot is blow:  
![pci list](doc_res/pci_list.png)

After pci/pcie devices scaning, it will showed all devices on list, 
  seperately by page.  
If this device is PCIE device, there is a '\*' preceding sign char.

Also, you could press:  

**KEY-UP, KEY-DOWN**  
  To move the cursor.

**PAGE-UP, PAGE-DOWN**  
  For previous/next devices page.

**Enter**  
  To show the PCI/PCIE configuration space.

## PCI/PCIE content
The screenshot is blow:  
![pci dev](doc_res/pci_dev.png)

When you select a pci/pcie device, you could see the content on this screen.  
If it's a pci device, you could only see total 256 Bytes content, 
  and of course, it's accessed by IO Port (Cf8/CFC).  
If it's a pcie device, you could see total 1K Bytes content, 
  and of course, it's accessed by MMIO if there is a MMIO Base.

The MMIO Base address could be found in 
```
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MCFG
```
That means, it need ACPI function in system.

Otherwise, you could directly assign mmio base through typing:
```
sudo bin/lfdk -B <MMIO BASE>
```

Of course, if the MMIO Base is not correct, we assume it's a pci device.  
And you could only see 256 Bytes pci configuration space.

Also, you could press:  

**KEY-UP, KEY-DOWN**  
  To move the cursor, and if it's a pcie device, above/below 256 Bytes range will show next/previous 256 Bytes.

**PAGE-UP, PAGE-DOWN**  
  For previous/next device content.

**F7**  
  To change view-mode. There are 3 modes: Byte, Word, DWord.

**\[any hex digit\]**  
  Start to input somthing, later press Enter to write the content if it's R/W register.


## IO
The screenshot is blow:  
![io](doc_res/io.png)

After entering this function, you should input an address aligned by 256Bytes.

Also, you could press:  

**KEY-UP, KEY-DOWN**  
  To move the cursor. 

**PAGE-UP, PAGE-DOWN**  
  For previous/next 256 Bytes content.

**F7**  
  To change view-mode. There are only 2 modes: Byte, Word

**\[any hex digit\]**  
  Start to input somthing, later press Enter to write the content if it's R/W register.


## CMOS
The screenshot is blow:  
![cmos](doc_res/cmos.png)

This function only show 256 Bytes content.

Also, you could press:  

**KEY-UP, KEY-DOWN**  
  To move the cursor. 

**\[any hex digit\]**  
  Start to input somthing, later press Enter to write the content if it's R/W register.

## Memory
The screenshot is blow:  
![memory](doc_res/memory.png)

After entering this function, you should input an address aligned by 256Bytes.

Also, you could press:  

**KEY-UP, KEY-DOWN**  
  To move the cursor. 

**PAGE-UP, PAGE-DOWN**  
  For previous/next 256 Bytes content.

**F7**  
  To change view-mode. There are 3 modes: Byte, Word, DWord

**\[any hex digit\]**  
  Start to input somthing, later press Enter to write the content if it's R/W register.

# Notice
You could see more log in lfdk.log located in current directory.  
Also, you could change debug level to see more log. (default is 4)

```
sudo bin/lfdk -D 5
```

Level 5 is verbose mode.  
If any number is bigger than 5, it is still level 5.
